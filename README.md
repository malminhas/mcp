=== Fetched Content Summary ===

The article "The True Nature of the Crisis" on Climate CTO's Substack delves into the complexities of tackling the climate crisis, emphasizing both technological and societal dimensions. The author, an experienced tech professional, explores the potential role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing climate issues. Through a session with London CTOs, they discussed the urgency of the climate situation, the potential solutions available, and the possibility of AI contributing to these solutions. 

The article begins with a polling of attendees about their concerns regarding climate change and their awareness of the "Net Zero" strategy, revealing a significant degree of worry and awareness in line with broader public sentiment, as evidenced by data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. This data shows that concern about climate change is growing, especially in lower-income countries and among younger populations, who often experience eco-anxiety and its impacts on mental health.

The article also acknowledges the role of educational programs like Terra.do's "Learning For Action" and initiatives like Climate Fresk, which inform and empower individuals about climate change and its mechanics. The definition of climate change is provided, highlighting key aspects such as human activity and its impact on atmospheric composition outside natural variation.

The discussion continues with a breakdown of human activities contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, with industry, building usage, transportation, and agriculture being significant contributors. The article explains how these activities lead to an alteration in atmospheric composition beyond natural absorption capabilities, resulting in increased CO2 levels and other greenhouse gases that significantly warm the planet.

Furthermore, the article discusses the principles of Energy Balance Models (EBM) and thermodynamics to illustrate the greenhouse effect, explaining how human activity causes energy imbalances that lead to global warming. The author outlines their work on a simplified EBM playbook, suggesting a model-based approach to understanding and predicting climate changes while underlining the complexity involved in integrating various human and natural feedback mechanisms into modeling efforts.

Overall, the article seeks to contextualize the climate crisis, emphasizing that collective awareness and action, informed by scientific and technological understanding, are crucial in addressing the challenges posed by climate change.
